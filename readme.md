# Neon Bots 2D
> Game similar to Asteroids

## To Do
- Add Physics module.
- Fix the way the angle between the unit's direction and the direction to the target is determined (`bots/Simple.js`).
- Fix a problem with touch controls, identify specific touch-points.
- Separate control methods (keyboard + mouse, touch, gamepad).
- Improve/rework the control scheme from “relative to the unit” to “relative to the viewport”.
- [Gamepad control](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API/Using_the_Gamepad_API).
- [Pathfinding](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pathfinding) and [heap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/heap) + [sample](http://qiao.github.io/PathFinding.js/visual/).
